Analysis output
All data files are saved as tab-delimited .txt files.
These may be easily imported into excel or another data processing software.
In addition to the data tables described below, ROIs for each image are saved as
.zip files within the AC_analysis folder. Each ROI zip file contains ROIs for cells, nuclei, and aggregates
in that order.
