Title: Image Processing-Based Quantification of Neural Aggregates for Huntingtonâ€™s Disease Detection
Main Research Question:
How can image processing methods be implemented to quantify neural aggregates in microscopy images for Huntingtonâ€™s disease detection?
Sub-Questions:
1. What preprocessing steps are necessary to enhance image quality for accurate aggregate detection?
2. How can cells be effectively detected in microscopy data before quantifying neural aggregates within them? 

I am planning to work based on this title and these research questions. Does it look appropriate to you? 
Iâ€™m working with .lif files. Which channel or channels (e.g., HA?) should I focus on for the best results?
Below is the workflow Iâ€™ve created:

Load the .lif file
Select the relevant channel
Merge the Z-slices (3D to 2D)
Detect cell boundaries
Find aggregates within those boundaries
However, cell detection is currently not working well. I will focus on it.  Why do you emphasize 3D? What are the advantages and disadvantages of working with 3D images versus 2D projections (like stacked 8 Z-slices)?
Until now, Iâ€™ve been collapsing the 3D data into a 2D image for easier processing. Do you think this is a valid method, or are there better alternatives for working with 3D data directly?
In the attached PDF file, I worked with a .lif image and tried to identify protein aggregates. You can ignore the code sections â€” the photos are the most important part.  Do you think the last image reflects the main goal of the project?

# Todo list
## 23.04.2025 
1. Read expert workshop slides 
2. Complete Introduction 
3. Compelete Background 
4. Mension about paper which you have read and reseach which you have done with lamia and self in the logbook, so hier.

### Proggess
* Introduction and background part has been wrote. It looks like compleete. I have got a mail from carolina about the answer of my question and it is more clear now. The project must be 3d image progessing. And the name of the paper and main question eddited. 

* The order of the Z-Stacks is not true in the python. I have been bussy wiht this error for 4 days i coudnt solve it yet.
