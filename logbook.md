Title: Image Processing-Based Quantification of Neural Aggregates for Huntingtonâ€™s Disease Detection
Main Research Question:
How can image processing methods be implemented to quantify neural aggregates in microscopy images for Huntingtonâ€™s disease detection?
Sub-Questions:
1. What preprocessing steps are necessary to enhance image quality for accurate aggregate detection?
2. How can cells be effectively detected in microscopy data before quantifying neural aggregates within them? 

I am planning to work based on this title and these research questions. Does it look appropriate to you? 
Iâ€™m working with .lif files. Which channel or channels (e.g., HA?) should I focus on for the best results?
Below is the workflow Iâ€™ve created:

Load the .lif file
Select the relevant channel
Merge the Z-slices (3D to 2D)
Detect cell boundaries
Find aggregates within those boundaries
However, cell detection is currently not working well. I will focus on it.  Why do you emphasize 3D? What are the advantages and disadvantages of working with 3D images versus 2D projections (like stacked 8 Z-slices)?
Until now, Iâ€™ve been collapsing the 3D data into a 2D image for easier processing. Do you think this is a valid method, or are there better alternatives for working with 3D data directly?
In the attached PDF file, I worked with a .lif image and tried to identify protein aggregates. You can ignore the code sections â€” the photos are the most important part.  Do you think the last image reflects the main goal of the project?

## Solution of the z-slice problem:
When you are try to anysis the foto of the cell
Python has a problem, when it works with the .lif file. it can open it but it struggle to show correct order of the z-slices, it shows just rondom slices. Now i have a solition. it is just convert file to .tiff file.
